Manuscript Results |build|
==========================
This repository contains the results described by Hoyt, *et al* (2019) in [1]_.

We applied the rational enrichment workflow described in https://github.com/bel-enrichment/bel-enrichment 
to ten knowledge graphs from the `NeuroMMSig <https://github.com/neurommsig/neurommsig-knowledge>`_ inventory.

Repository Structure
--------------------
- **rounds**: Contains four subfolders corresponding to the four rounds of rational enrichment that 
  were done in the course of this work. Each round contains several folders named with HGNC gene 
  symbols in which there are three files: one with the INDRA statements as a Python pickle file,
  one with the original curation sheet generated, and one with the annotations from the curator.
- **main.py**: Uses the `bel_enrichment <https://github.com/bel-enrichment/bel-enrichment>`_ package
  to generate new curation sheets and make intermediate summary sheets. Requires installation of all
  Python packages listed in ``requirements.txt``.
- **notebooks**: Contains the notebooks used to generate the statistics and figures appearing in the
  manuscript
- **data**: Contains intermediate results generated by the notebooks.
