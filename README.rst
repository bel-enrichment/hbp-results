Manuscript Results |build|
==========================
This repository contains the results described by Hoyt, *et al* (2019) in [1]_.

We applied the rational enrichment workflow described in https://github.com/bel-enrichment/bel-enrichment 
to ten knowledge graphs from the `NeuroMMSig <https://github.com/neurommsig/neurommsig-knowledge>`_ inventory.

Repository Structure
--------------------
- **rounds**: Contains four sub-folders corresponding to the four rounds of rational enrichment that
  were done in the course of this work. Each round contains several folders named with HGNC gene 
  symbols in which there are three files: one with the INDRA statements as a Python pickle file,
  one with the original curation sheet generated, and one with the annotations from the curator.
- **hbp_enrichment.py**: Uses the `bel_enrichment <https://github.com/bel-enrichment/bel-enrichment>`_ package
  to generate new curation sheets and make intermediate summary sheets. Requires installation of all
  Python packages listed in ``setup.cfg``.
- **notebooks**: Contains the notebooks used to generate the statistics and figures appearing in the
  manuscript
- **data**: Contains intermediate results generated by the notebooks.

Installation
------------
This repository requires a particular package structure and can currently only be installed with pip in development
mode using the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/bel-enrichment/results.git
    $ cd results
    $ pip install -e .

It can be imported and used with the following. Note that it installs at a different name than the GitHub repository.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from hbp_enrichment import repository
    >>> graph = repository.get_graph()
    >>> graph.summarize()
