27d23fdd-1f28-4334-a50f-394610214977	1.0	PubMed	12054597	Addition of PDGF-BB (100 ng/ml) raised the expression levels of LUM (4-fold), CHI3L1 (9-fold), and CHI3L2 (11-fold) above those of normal medium () and, thus, stimulated the expansion related genes even further ().	p(FPLX:"PDGF_BB")	directlyIncreases	p(HGNC:CHI3L2)
40deb488-b07b-4dff-a715-4db7e37a26aa	1.0	PubMed	25826113	CHI3L2 has recently been reported to activate the MAPK pathway through phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in glial tumor cells.	p(HGNC:CHI3L2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(FPLX:ERK))
c66552e9-92c9-4881-aa65-9e974d11cfb5	1.0	PubMed	22211103	In contrast to the activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by CHI3L1 that leads to a proliferative signal (similar to the EGF effect in PC12 cells), activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by CHI3L2 (similar to NGF) inhibits cell mitogenesis and proliferation.	p(HGNC:CHI3L2)	directlyIncreases	p(FPLX:ERK, pmod(Ph))
