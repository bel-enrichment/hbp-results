70cb3cbd-71d8-4cf8-8043-a821237378de	1.0	26435501	We further demonstrated that Angptl2 stimulated murine peritoneal cells produced IL-6 and TNFalpha in a dose dependent manner, reaching the maximal induction level to the same extent by 100ng/ml LPS stimulation (A).	p(HGNC:ANGPTL2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:TNF))
5bd8d7d9-ab9a-42a7-8475-2bce05bda53a	1.0	6892796	Angiogenin isolated from cow milk induces the production of cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in human leukocytes; the level of production of each cytokine depends on the concentration of the preparation, and the dynamics of production depends on the time from the beginning of induction.	p(HGNC:ANG)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:TNF))
