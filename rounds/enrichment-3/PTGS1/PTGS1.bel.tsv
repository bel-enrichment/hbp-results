a05fc13d-d794-4c8e-be9d-8a74741890e9	1.0	24395886	To determine whether inhibition COX-2 impacts the proliferation of TSC2 deficient cells, we treated 621-101 cells with Sulindac (a COX-1 inhibitor), NS398 (a COX-2 inhibitor), or aspirin (an irreversible COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor that works by blocking enzymatic activities, and also acetylates COX-2, resulting in production of 15-epi-LXA 4, an antiinflammatory and antitumor compound) for 24 h. NS398 and aspirin reduced COX-2 and COX-1 levels without affecting phosphorylation of p44/42-MAPK or S6 (XREF_FIG).	p(HGNC:PTGS1)	directlyIncreases	p(HGNC:PTGS2, pmod(Ac))
