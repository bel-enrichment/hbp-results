c3f2e7d9-ef25-44a7-b3ca-fa31fcfb7102	1.0	10187842	We now demonstrate that amino acids 1-92 of hPPARalpha contain an activation function (AF)-1-like domain, which is further activated by insulin through a pathway involving the mitogen-activated protein kinases p42 and p44. Further analysis of the amino-terminal region of PPARalpha revealed that the insulin-induced trans-activation occurs through the phosphorylation of two mitogen-activated protein kinase sites at positions 12 and 21, both of which are conserved across evolution.	p(HGNC:MAPK3)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:PPARA))
