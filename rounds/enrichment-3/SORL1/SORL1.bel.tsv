bd194cef-938c-4917-8e17-0f72c09799f8	1.0	25772071	We propose that the variation in SORL1 expression induction by BDNF is modulated by common genetic variants and can explain how genetic variation in this one locus can contribute to an individual 's risk of developing SAD.	p(HGNC:BDNF)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:SORL1))
7ac0afc4-e640-4806-877a-6a79ccc8fba1	1.0	25772071	In contrast, SORL1 knockdown neurons treated with cAMP still exhibited a reduction of Abeta peptides (XREF_FIG), indicating that, in purified neurons, cAMP regulates pathways in addition to SORL1 that can impact Abeta production independently.	a(CHEBI:17489)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:SORL1))

55d1aa7d-ff50-4a6d-b740-eb1806f24f4a	1.0	22621900	These data highlight the possibility that GGA1 mediates traffic of BACE1 and LR11 and that each pathway culminates in distinct consequences related to APP processing to Abeta.	p(HGNC:GGA1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:SORL1))
cebac635-fa96-4b88-9e97-fcfdcec62226	1.0	5679532	In addition, HA stimulates SorLA synthesis hinting at an autocatalytic feedback loop in which the ligand activates production, processing, and translocation of its receptor.	p(UP:P69208)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:SORL1))

879b180a-a33c-4921-b247-cc7172f84ccd	1.0	23673467	3 Furthermore, we showed that under-expression of SORL1 leads to overexpression of Abeta and an increased risk of AD.	p(HGNC:SORL1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(PFAM:PF09793))
990e83e0-f354-434a-a9ad-7b7f28059593	1.0	19368828	Other studies also described the alternate alleles as risk factor for AD i.e. a SORL1 3 marker haplotype including the SNP23 A allele increased AD risk in non Hispanic whites from northern Manhattan (), while the initial study implicated the SNP23 T-allele as risk allele for AD.A just recently published genome wide screen for AD in a genetically isolated Dutch population, however, failed to confirm the association of SORL1 gene with AD risk ().	p(HGNC:SORL1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(PFAM:PF09793))

3ececf78-9339-4065-97d2-3639a9b2e4b9	1.0	22734645	SorLA, like LRP10, retains APP in the Golgi compartment, increases the half-life of mature APP, and reduces APP processing by beta-secretase in the early endosome, thus decreasing the production of Abeta [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR].	p(HGNC:SORL1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:APP))
f83da751-0dd5-4328-9a5a-5ce0f1ae17c7	1.0	23977241	Recently, the relevance of SORLA as a neuroprotective factor received independent support by findings that Sorl1 (the gene encoding SORLA) is a downstream target of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor that signals through tropomyosin related kinase receptor (TrkB) to promote neuronal survival XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR.	p(HGNC:SORL1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:BDNF))

c11bf4e7-cfc7-4e24-84e9-31400d89a659	1.0	23164340	This study, however, did not investigate whether increased SORLA mediated LPL conferred changes in lipid homeostasis, and this could be of interest for future studies.As cellular localisation of lipid metabolising enzymes is crucial for determining lipid levels, it would be of interest in future post-mortem studies to investigate synaptosome proteomics to determine whether variations in localisation of lipid trafficking and lipoprotein processing would confer alterations in lipid levels.	p(HGNC:SORL1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:LPL))
