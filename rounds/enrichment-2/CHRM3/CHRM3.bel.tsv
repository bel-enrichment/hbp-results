b5f55b1a-7387-478f-96d0-8fe88542df68	1.0	23455440	Because CHRM3 is known to show a selectivity for G protein coupled signal transduction similar to that found in CHRM1 mediated pathways, the down regulation of CHRM3 expression could also contribute to the deregulation of intracellular Ca 2+ mobilization in HD [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR].	p(HGNC:CHRM3)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:HTT))
f82ff8a0-7339-4bac-9966-bbf585dceef9	1.0	28053981	Although CHRM3 cholinergic receptor has been reported to promote cancer cell proliferation via stimulating MEK and ERK signaling in several different cancers [XREF_BIBR], its role in the bladder cancer have not been estimated yet.	p(HGNC:CHRM3)	directlyIncreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0008283"))
