1a2b7d44-32a4-4186-b9e0-962aacc5737a	1.0	10939334	Thus, we conclude that the interaction of coiled-coil domains in the C termini of GB1 and GB2 is necessary and sufficient for shielding of the retention motif RSRR in the tail of GB1, and that this effect persists even in the absence of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of GB1.Previous studies have shown that GB1 expressed by itself can not activate ion channel effectors such as GIRKs in oocytes, and that only very rare activation of GIRKs by GB1 is observed in mammalian cell lines ().	p(HGNC:GABBR1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(PFAM:PF07885))
