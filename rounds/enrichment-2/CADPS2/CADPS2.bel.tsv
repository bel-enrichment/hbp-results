3b091ae2-877a-4af9-8df3-6963849913ce	1.0	14715936	Thus, we suggest that CAPS2 mediates the depolarization dependent release of NT-3 and BDNF from granule cells, leading to regulation in cell differentiation and survival during cerebellar development.	p(HGNC:CADPS2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:BDNF))
4b2c532f-cb7c-4368-ad56-29023be23657	1.0	24737869	The additional regulation of CADPS2 expression via monoallelic expression in the amygdala, which plays a key role in regulating social interactions, supports the importance of a fine modulation of CADPS2 for human behavior.	p(HGNC:CADPS2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:CADPS2))

5c82fb41-375e-4789-8616-aacce54c4da6	1.0	15857609	As shown in B, the CAPS2 truncation fragment displayed a positive interaction with the D2 receptor IC2 domain and produced similar levels of beta-galactosidase activity as the CAPS1/D2 interaction.	p(HGNC:CADPS2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:GLB1))

156a25a8-6011-4152-9131-7b89f59d35a5	1.0	15857609	The two CAPS isoforms exhibit distinct differences in expression patterns within the brain, and CAPS2 has been shown to selectively mediate release of the neurotrophins, BDNF and neurotrophin-3, and cell survival in PC12 cells.	p(HGNC:CADPS2)	directlyIncreases	act(bp(MESH:D002470))
