7f93175d-5a83-45db-98b1-b0fc3447b0ba	1.0	25514242	Although the exact signaling mechanism remains unknown, they have shown that LRP-1 promotes NF-kappaB signaling in this model [XREF_BIBR].	p(HGNC:LRP1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(FPLX:NFkappaB))
4fb5aa53-4257-462b-8adf-4d9ec7a92ee8	1.0	25358504	In addition, XREF_BIBR demonstrated that activation of LRP1 by other ligands, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) or alpha2-macroglobulin, activates Src family kinase and TrK receptor in neurons (XREF_FIG).	p(HGNC:LRP1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:NTRK1))
00ab2db1-3037-4433-86e6-263a76988577	1.0	20472562	Our data suggest that LRP1 and TSP2 stimulate Notch activity by driving trans-endocytosis of the Notch ectodomain into the signal sending cell and demonstrate a novel, non cell autonomous function of LRP1 in cell-cell signaling.	p(HGNC:LRP1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(FPLX:Notch))
0d43c5f6-72f9-4df2-ac23-345b14ea6734	1.0	23922991	In summary, findings in the present study demonstrate that LRP1 modulates SHP-2-mediated PDGFRbeta signaling events.	p(HGNC:LRP1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:PDGFRB))
0721c450-74a7-4e1e-bfaa-dd007d1e4532	1.0	23922991	Our results reveal that LRP1 modulates SHP-2-mediated PDGF mediated chemotaxis.	p(HGNC:LRP1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(FPLX:PDGF))
0ae2d3bc-d867-4755-bf7c-57fe5e13a2cf	1.0	23922991	In contrast, inhibiting SHP-2 phosphatase activity in LRP1 deficient cells effectively blocks PDGF-BB chemotactic migration.	p(HGNC:LRP1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(FPLX:"PDGF_BB"))
