976e23a5-59e5-47ba-ad8e-f562934f7f75	1.0	21345331	Indeed, calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CamK-II) was shown to phosphorylate KIF17 on Ser 209 to trigger the release of its cargo protein Mint1, which is a scaffolding protein involved in transporting the subunit 2B of the NMDA receptor in neurons.	p(HGNC:KIF17)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:APBA1))
37daa4e3-7524-4187-88a5-a4443476d3b2	1.0	24792907	Similarly to Homer3, overexpression of X11 resulted in increased levels of full length APP and decreased levels of APP and/or CTFs relative to cells transfected with APP alone (Parisiadou etal., 2007,).	p(HGNC:APBA1)	directlyDecreases	p(HGNC:APP)
