8159022c-81b8-49aa-9c8c-a39947cad4f9	1.0	23299939	We show that both Chtop and Alyref activate the ATPase and RNA helicase activities of Uap56 and that Uap56 functions to recruit both Alyref and Chtop onto mRNA.	p(HGNC:ALYREF)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:DDX39B))
0dccec68-08d0-4753-8c06-dfde1397a839	1.0	23299939	We show that both Chtop and Alyref activate the ATPase and RNA helicase activities of Uap56 and that Uap56 functions to recruit both Alyref and Chtop onto mRNA.	p(HGNC:CHTOP)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:DDX39B))
1295a8d1-33d7-44a1-b374-599a64e309ba	1.0	12438415	Indeed, as expected for a helicase, UAP56 could trigger ATP dependent rearrangements of the mRNP at specific stages of the export process.	p(HGNC:DDX39B)	directlyIncreases	act(a(CHEBI:15422))
af061753-fcd6-4d3d-8072-5bac316558b6	1.0	20116367	These data suggest that UAP56 is an important mediator of PE induced protein synthesis and cardiac hypertrophy.	p(HGNC:DDX39B)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:PREP))
3927fdd5-2a4d-49d5-85d2-95f9643aa56f	1.0	20828777	There was no detectable ORF57 pre-mRNA (unspliced) in the RPA assays, indicating that knockdown of UAP56 and RBM15 did not prevent ORF57 RNA splicing.	p(HGNC:DDX39B)	directlyIncreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0008380"))
57464a4f-667a-4ab1-9022-fc400fa911b2	1.0	20573985	Either UAP56 or URH49 can rescue the lethality of the Sub2 deletion strain in S. cerevisiae, and both are required for bulk poly (A) + RNA export, implying that UAP56 and URH49 have a similar function.	p(HGNC:DDX39B)	directlyIncreases	act(p(UP:A6R603))
efcd9f70-48b2-46a5-8bdb-a0740d8fd87b	1.0	22446327	This effect may occur in part due to UAP56 dependent modulation of cell cycle progression.	p(HGNC:DDX39B)	directlyIncreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0007049"))
8989115e-5bb5-40d4-b9ab-843851870dfe	1.0	21799930	For instance, it was shown that UAP56 and URH49 interact with the nuclear cytokine induced protein CIP29 (alternatively named HCC-1), that is implicated in the regulation of cell-cycle progression XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR.	complex(p(HGNC:DDX39B))	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:SARNP))
c565c3c5-1f79-47f7-a513-6397e244fbcc	1.0	20116367	Cardiomyocytes were treated with UAP56 siRNA or control siRNA and then treated with or without PE 50 muM for four hours.	p(HGNC:PREP)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:DDX39B))
a4ec8fd1-7d20-4ec2-a63d-ec27b6795aeb	1.0	21799930	To address this question, FLAG-UAP56 or FLAG-URH49 transfected HeLa cells were treated with the CRM1 specific inhibitor LMB (XREF_FIG, panels e-h) or kept untreated (panels a-d) and heterokaryon assays were performed as described above.	p(HGNC:XPO1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:DDX39B))
0f09d143-5e5f-4373-a5d7-e9dfe3013b59	1.0	20116367	Cardiomyocytes were transfected with 50 nM of UAP56 or control siRNA for 72 hours and treated with or without phenylephrine (50 muM) for four hours.	a(PUBCHEM:6041)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:DDX39B))
