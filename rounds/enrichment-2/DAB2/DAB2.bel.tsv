c9159d7c-64da-4e7e-9f6c-e665ef05e82a	1.0	25879443	The forskolin and genistein stimulated currents were roughly double in the Dab2 depleted monolayers compared to the controls (XREF_FIG; 18.8 +/- 0.2 compared to 10.5 +/- 0.3 muA/cm 2, respectively).	a(PUBCHEM:47936)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:DAB2))
ce6550d3-da4c-4ec5-86f4-7a25ce8d905f	1.0	25879443	The forskolin and genistein stimulated currents were roughly double in the Dab2 depleted monolayers compared to the controls (XREF_FIG; 18.8 +/- 0.2 compared to 10.5 +/- 0.3 muA/cm 2, respectively).	a(CHEBI:28088)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:DAB2))
41805b6e-0ec3-422c-b3a2-32a905608e77	1.0	19956625	Overall, our results support a mechanism of sulfatide mediated Dab2 internalization that is lipid raft and clathrin independent but actin cytoskeleton dependent.	a(PUBCHEM:53481404)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:DAB2))
14eed585-bcf5-4dee-ac96-199c9ee76608	1.0	10542228	Mutational analysis revealed that a dab2 ser(24) phosphorylation mutant (s24a) abrogated the inhibitory function of dab2.	p(HGNC:DAB2, pmod(Ph, Ser, 24))	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:DAB2))
