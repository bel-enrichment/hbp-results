1ccd93f0-df44-4c0d-be18-bcc31dfa4d71	1.0	24112793	Such a hypothetical model is particularly relevant to the APBB2 x GSK3beta interaction because APBB2 appears to drive the intracellular production of both APP and GSK-3.	p(HGNC:APBB2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:APP))
f75d45a9-b417-48d5-8b90-febc0ddbcc7b	1.0	24112793	Such a hypothetical model is particularly relevant to the APBB2 x GSK3beta interaction because APBB2 appears to drive the intracellular production of both APP and GSK-3.	p(HGNC:APBB2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(FPLX:GSK3))
19375719-26ac-4b94-8005-19f90e24df60	1.0	17183645	As shown in XREF_FIG, both the mRNA and APBB2 protein were upregulated ~ 2.5 fold in NPC1 cells as determined by immunoblotting of cell extracts.	p(HGNC:APBB2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:NPC1))
f9b51de3-4ee0-410f-b2ba-cb2388d297e6	1.0	5641830	Replacement of the N-terminal PTB domain with GFP failed to abolish the FE65L mediated TNF resistance.	p(HGNC:APBB2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:TNF))
d967db8b-40bf-411b-9c83-dd1ffa50b49f	1.0	23384821	Studies in cell cultures demonstrated that over-expression of APBB2 increased gamma-secretase processing of betaAPP and promoted formation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), the main constituent of senile plaques, characteristic of AD pathology ().	p(HGNC:APBB2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(UP:O73683))
9746423d-b342-4bb2-9e3e-03cdacd6e32b	1.0	5641830	Hyaluronidase downregulates the expression of FE65L gene and protein in L929 cells, and this correlates with its enhancement of TNF killing of these cells.	p(PFAM:PF01630)	directlyDecreases	p(HGNC:APBB2)
6ac5b263-5cf0-4dd7-a926-83136d2a537a	1.0	14527950	Overexpression of FE65 and FE65L1 was previously reported to increase the levels of alpha-secretase-derived APP (APPs alpha).	p(HGNC:APBB2)	directlyIncreases	p(HGNC:APP)
49d35003-c2eb-417c-838f-ca1717ee31e5	1.0	6378619	In neuronal PC12 cells, the overexpression of Fe65 or of Fe65L1 and Fe65L2 blocks cell cycle, as observed in fibroblasts, but thymidine supplementation to culture medium does not revert this block, thus suggesting that Fe65 proteins induce in neuronal cells a gene expression program different from that activated in fibroblasts.	p(HGNC:APBB2)	directlyDecreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0007049"))
3baf6ff2-928a-4242-bedd-4da765c1aae0	1.0	5641830	A prolonged exposure of L929 cells to these inhibitors for 24 h resulted in cell death, whereas FE65L significantly blocked the cell death.	p(HGNC:APBB2)	directlyDecreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0008219"))
