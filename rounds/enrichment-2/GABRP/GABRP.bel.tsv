6039cba1-2241-4b07-a694-47aef657f6f6	1.0	27221053	Based on the increased apoptosis of trophoblastic cells in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia (PE) and the fact that GABRP promotes the apoptosis of trophoblastic cells, we hypothesized that GABRP expression is increased in the placental tissues from patients with PE compared with that in the normal groups and this hypothesis was confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical analysis.	p(HGNC:GABRP)	directlyIncreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0006915"))

e3b672db-aa9d-42ec-9be8-265036d9e897	1.0	27221053	In our previous study, we suggested that GABRP impaired remodeling of the decidua (XREF_BIBR), and in the present study, we have demonstrated that GABRP promotes apoptosis and hence, inhibits the invasion of trophoblastic cells.	p(HGNC:GABRP)	directlyIncreases	act(bp(MESH:D009361))
