Furthermore, it is shown that up-regulation of IGFl1 activity is independent of eIF4E levels, and activity of IGFl1 is observed in all tissues of transgenic Xenopus embryos.	p(HGNC:IGFL1)	directlyIncreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0006412"))

d3fd3563-19be-479e-ae27-9a4314fd3a5c	1.0	25842288	In contrast, AIRE transfected fibroblasts from Pt1 and Pt2 had reduced induction of IGFL1 in comparison with that in control subjects (XREF_FIG).	p(HGNC:AIRE)	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:IGFL1))
cac52f45-6346-4269-a621-441beacd2492	1.0	5761964	The results demonstrate that IGFl1 strongly represses translation of a reporter in early embryos, compared with the Xenopus beta-globin 5 ' UTR.	p(HGNC:IGFL1)	directlyDecreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0006412"))
