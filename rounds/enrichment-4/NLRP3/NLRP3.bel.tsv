b55d834a-d740-4bbd-9c69-f0430ae20c73	0.86	9382896	Accordingly, inhibition of I AC by both ACTH and AII require G-protein intermediates ( xref ; xref ).	sparser	p(HGNC:NLRP3)	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:ADCY1))
4f783251-cca7-46ab-b1f9-5d096fb56587	1.0	9702074	AII activates MAPK by tyrosine phosphorylating the EGF receptor by the mechanism called transactivation with subsequent Ras activation in vascular smooth muscle and cardiac fibroblast cells.	sparser	p(HGNC:NLRP3)	directlyIncreases	act(p(FPLX:ERK))
44f2e409-0ddf-433b-b72a-69a0647e4c31	0.97	9875235	AII pretreatment inhibited LIF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in a dose dependent manner.	sparser	p(HGNC:NLRP3)	directlyIncreases	p(HGNC:STAT3, pmod(Ph))
