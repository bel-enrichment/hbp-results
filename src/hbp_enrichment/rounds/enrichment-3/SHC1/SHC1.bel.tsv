e23211ac-4a89-4805-820c-03e91619263b	1.0	12185581	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk), which turned out to be one of these phosphoproteins, was constitutively activated and associated with the ptb domain of shcc in three neuroblastoma cells. In vitro kinase assay revealed that shcc is a potent substrate of the activated alk kinase. The alk gene locus was significantly amplified in both of these cell lines, suggesting that gene amplification leads to constitutive activation of the alk kinase, which results in hyperphosphorylation of shcc.	p(HGNC:ALK)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:SHC1))

CD4/Lck-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation on Shc was markedly diminished when Y317 was mutated, suggesting a preference of Lck for the Y317 site.  tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc may play a key role in T lymphocyte proliferation via interaction of phosphorylated Shc with downstream molecules involved in activation of Ras and Myc proteins	p(HGNC:SHC1, pmod(Ph, Tyr, 427))	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:SHC1))
