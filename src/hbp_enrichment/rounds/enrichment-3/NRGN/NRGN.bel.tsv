2384e320-e27b-4b44-9b29-babae450d050	1.0	8080473	Phosphorylation of RC3 by PKC alpha, beta, or gamma was stimulated by Ca2+, phospholipid, and diacylglycerol. A single site, Ser36, which is adjacent to the predicted calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain, was phosphorylated by these enzymes. Phosphorylation of RC3 by PKC or PKM, a protease-degraded PKC, was inhibited by CaM. The effect of CaM apparently targets at RC3, as phosphorylation of protamine sulfate by PKM was not inhibited by CaM.	p(HGNC:NRGN, pmod(Ph, Ser, 36))	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:NRGN))
