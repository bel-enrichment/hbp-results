6efaee19-4df3-4b15-a5c4-19d0188ea9f2	1.0	26948053	However, the regulation of HIF-1 during normoxia is not well characterised, although Mint3 was recently found to activate HIF-1 in cancer cells and macrophages by suppressing the HIF-1 inhibitor, factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1).	p(HGNC:APBA3)	directlyIncreases	act(p(FPLX:HIF1))

e272be22-4bb8-4b97-8885-173d8a4a1540	1.0	20016085	We then found that APP, Mint3 and TAZ and YAP form transcriptionally active triple protein complexes, and that the regulation of APP processing modulates the activities of Mint3 and TAZ and Mint3 and YAP complexes.	p(HGNC:APP)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:APBA3))

4a863e15-d9bb-4f4c-9c9a-0174a7280091	1.0	26948053	As we reported previously, inhibition of FIH-1 by endogenous Mint3 requires MT1-MMP, although overexpression of Mint3 is sufficient by itself to inhibit FIH-1 because of altered cytoplasmic localisation XREF_BIBR XREF_BIBR.	p(HGNC:APBA3)	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:HIF1AN))
ecdf41dd-f0e6-476b-a808-98bc03b2aec8	1.0	19726677	Knockdown of Mint3 expression in macrophages leads to redistribution of FIH-1 to the cytoplasm and decreases glycolysis and ATP production.	p(HGNC:APBA3)	directlyDecreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0006096"))
