640c3765-5a5b-49c3-83cb-56087d64d357	1.0	26005849	Here we establish in a novel model of a severe human genetic epileptic encephalopathy, the Gabrg2 +/Q390X knock-in mouse, that in addition to impairing inhibitory neurotransmission, mutant GABA A receptor gamma2 (Q390X) subunits accumulated and aggregated intracellularly, activated caspase 3 and caused widespread, age dependent neurodegeneration.	p(HGNC:GABRG2)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:CASP3))

79147922-3701-46e2-959e-57efb8d9ac17	1.0	26005849	Furthermore, we demonstrated that Gabrg2 +/Q390X mice had increased mortality, reminiscent of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in humans.	p(HGNC:GABRG2)	directlyIncreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0008219"))
c2ae25c5-a665-43af-bf14-cf4c715dbdf1	1.0	26005849	The expression level of caspase 3 in the cells expressing mutant gamma2 (Q390X) subunits was similar to the control cells treated with the apoptosis-inducer staurosporine (3 muM) for 4 hrs (XREF_FIG); in contrast, caspase 3 activation was not or only minimally present in the cells expressing wild-type gamma2 subunits (XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY for the full-length gel).	a(PUBCHEM:44259)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:GABRG2))
44c5877d-a893-4c74-a2b9-96bcf0d80195	1.0	24407264	The heterozygosity of the GABRG2 (p.R136 *) mutation would be expected to reduce the number and density of functional GABA A receptor complexes at inhibitory synapses because the mutant gamma2 (p.R136 *) subunits were retained inside somata regions and could not be trafficked to dendrites and synapses as shown in XREF_FIG.	p(HGNC:GABRG2)	directlyDecreases	act(a(PUBCHEM:119))
a17a5928-82c8-455b-a575-821ae9127848	1.0	26005849	The data also suggested that the mutant gamma2 (Q390X) subunits suppressed the biogenesis of their wild-type partnering subunits and wild-type gamma2 subunits.	p(HGNC:GABRG2)	directlyDecreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0044085"))
d6614404-fbb5-41a9-bf05-6c1ce5604942	1.0	22750526	These results demonstrated that the gamma2S subunit mutation, Q40X, disrupted translation of mature gamma2S subunits and generated a truncated protein composed of the signal peptide.	p(HGNC:GABRG2)	directlyDecreases	act(bp(GO:"GO:0006412"))
d55b94f8-ab8c-4cc1-b219-7513442f6dc5	1.0	22539854	The mutation generates a PTC in the last exon, so the mature mutant GABRG2 (Q390X) mRNA should not be degraded by NMD and should be translated to truncated gamma2 (Q390X) subunits (XREF_BIBR).	p(HGNC:PLA1A)	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:GABRG2, var("p.?")))
60924645-4f10-4709-afd6-8e2381a140fc	1.0	1334371	RH mapping eliminated the candidate genes GABRA1 and GABRG2, which encode GABA-A receptor components, by showing that they are telomeric to the target region.	a(PUBCHEM:23948)	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:GABRG2))
