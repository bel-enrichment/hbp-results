d4bbf878-71a8-4ede-b604-cdfa45b0ceae	1.0	19222704	Our observations raise the possibility that insufficient association of APP with X11 and/or X11L caused by aberrant phosphorylation of Ser236 and/or Ser238 in brain may increase amyloidogenic metabolism of APP and trigger AD pathologies.	p(HGNC:APP)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:APBA2))
a9563f7a-73bd-4051-9d04-aa3ebbc4b6ce	1.0	27052102	It is of interest that ADAM10, ADAM17, APBA2, APPBP2, and RTN1 were previously identified as upregulated by 82-kDa ChAT in a gene expression microarray XREF_BIBR.	p(HGNC:CHAT)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:APBA2))
1eb6cf9d-ed2f-4074-849e-3240a020d2e4	1.0	19222704	HEK293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-APPT668A and HA-X11L were treated with or without sorbitol and APP T668A was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody.	a(PUBCHEM:5780)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:APBA2))
961bf569-ecdd-40fb-b550-73c711274d13	1.0	5136298	In Mint2 and APP cotransfected cells, Mint2 reorganizes the subcellular distribution of APP and also increases the steady-state levels of APP.	p(HGNC:APBA2)	directlyIncreases	p(HGNC:APP)
f1b74f3b-c8e0-407a-a8a1-84aab3026e40	1.0	19222704	Sorbitol increased the amount of HA-X11L coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-APPT668A to the same extent as with wild-type APP (compare lanes 11 and 12 to lanes 7 and 8 in second row of XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY).	a(PUBCHEM:5780)	directlyIncreases	p(HGNC:APBA2)
4175424c-042e-4919-ad50-bdcb6682e656	1.0	18936252	Munc18, an X11 and X11L interacting protein, synergistically accelerates the inhibitory effects of X11 on APP processing through direct and indirect functional interactions between X11 and Munc18 in HEK293 cells (XREF_BIBR).	p(HGNC:APBA2)	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:APBA1))
ab19efe8-6bde-41d1-80ff-9e747afcd627	1.0	18936252	Overexpression of X11 or X11L, which are predominantly expressed in neurons, suppresses APP processing and Abeta generation in HEK293 cells (XREF_BIBR).	p(HGNC:APBA2)	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:APP))
b6ddf692-c878-4c70-9b2c-e2a2d7aec0bc	1.0	12972431	X11L stabilizes APP metabolism and suppresses the secretion of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) that are the pathogenic agents of Alzheimer 's disease (AD).	p(HGNC:APBA2)	directlyDecreases	act(p(PFAM:PF14350))
d4ed974d-9a53-4677-85c5-cc16757c5641	1.0	10833507	The protein XB51 inhibited the association of X11L with amyloid precursor protein through a non competitive mechanism and abolished the suppression of beta-amyloid production by X11L.	p(HGNC:NECAB3)	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:APBA2))
