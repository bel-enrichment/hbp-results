b31630d4-012d-4299-91b9-48754577ac15	1.0	22152016	We had previously reported that CXCL12 could induce in vivo invasion in the MMTV-PyMT transgenic breast cancer model, and that this invasion was dependent on the EGF and CSF -1 paracrine loop between cancer cells and macrophages where CSF-1 is secreted by cancer cells and stimulates macrophages to produce EGF [XREF_BIBR].	p(HGNC:CSF1)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:EGF))
