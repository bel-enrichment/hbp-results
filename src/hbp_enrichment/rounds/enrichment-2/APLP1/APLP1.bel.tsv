8ff79b41-549e-4054-9c05-c72a05f70a23	1.0	16531006	However, cAMP synthesis in our experiments was not significantly altered in cells expressing APLP1 alone when compared with cells transfected with empty control plasmid although APP and APLP1 may differ in their potential to modulate cAMP synthesis.The exact functions of the APP family members are still unknown, but they have been implicated in synaptogenesis and maintenance of synaptic function and knock-out mice revealed that APP, APLP1 and APLP2 are functionally redundant.	p(HGNC:APLP1)	directlyIncreases	act(a(CHEBI:17489))

6fef48f0-de9f-404f-9e3b-3e291c03f278	1.0	21878106	As we can not exclude a potential functional redundancy between sAPPalpha and sAPLP2alpha, we avoid a potential compensatory effect of sAPLPalpha in the present study by using the GM6001 MMP inhibitor that inhibits APLP1,2 cleavage by alpha-secretase as well.	a(PUBCHEM:132519)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:APLP1))

abf81e74-7129-4a64-a8c8-7b61317b2021	1.0	23874953	These results suggest that : (a) nuclear localization is an intrinsic property of all APP family ICDs, (b) a certain threshold level for ICDs has to be reached for nuclear translocation to occur, and (c) slow turnover of full-length APLP1 sequesters Fe65, rendering it unavailable for nuclear translocation of ICDs.	p(HGNC:APLP1)	directlyDecreases	act(p(HGNC:APBB1))
