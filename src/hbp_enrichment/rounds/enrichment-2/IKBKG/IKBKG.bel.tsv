9725def1-5db8-4f1a-9f22-1519f0b97113	1.0	15371500	Activation of IKK may also influence the toxicity of mutant Htt, because expression of IKKgamma promotes aggregation and nuclear localization of mutant Htt exon-1.	p(HGNC:IKBKG)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:SLC6A4, var("p.?")))
1903a82e-4dbf-437e-9674-e63e87dc4557	1.0	22513115	This finding is consistent with the well-known insight that NEMO is the absolutely necessity in TNF-alpha induced canonical NF-kappaB activation.	p(HGNC:IKBKG)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:TNF))
22d01aa8-d432-4202-b604-ef54761cff6a	1.0	16129784	This conclusion fits well with our previous observation that NEMO serves as the Lys63 chain target (XREF_BIBR) and supports a recently proposed model (XREF_BIBR) in which the MALT1 oligomers bind to TRAF6, induce TRAF6 oligomerization, and activate the E3 activity of TRAF6 to polyubiquitinate NEMO in the presence of Ubc13-Uev.	p(HGNC:IKBKG)	directlyIncreases	act(p(HGNC:TRAF6))
